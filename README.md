### Deployed at

https://silpagui.github.io/cash-flow-chart-project/

This app requires cors-heroku as proxy. To be able to access the data of the endpoints you will need first go to https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ and follow the instructions on that page to get access to a temporary CORS proxy. After that you can go back to the home page ( https://silpagui.github.io/cash-flow-chart-project/ ) and refresh it.

Thank you!
